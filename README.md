# Guidelines
- Each experiment or analysis must be placed in a subfolder, with its individual environment so as to not contaminate other experiments.

## Installing the virtual environment

It is important to move to the subfolder and trigger the setup script from there.
```
cd project
../setup_venv_with_unfccc_documents_database.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```
